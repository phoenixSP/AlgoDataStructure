# ðŸŸ¡ Non-overlapping Intervals

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

Note: if two intervals have the same starting and ending points, they are not considered overlapping

        Solution: 

        Note: if two intervals have the same starting and ending points, they are not considered overlapping

        - Sort the list of intervals 
        - Iterate over the list and keep track of the end of the previous interval
        - If prevEnd <= current_start, there is no overlap. 
            - Else, consider the interval that ends first
            - Update the prevEnd based on the min(prevEnd, currEnd)
            - increase count of interval removal by 1
