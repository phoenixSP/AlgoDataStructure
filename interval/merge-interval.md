# ðŸŸ¡ Merge interval

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

        Solution: 

        - Problem does not say if the intervals are sorted by their starting times, so sort it first 
        - iterate over sorted intervals and keep track of previous interval
        - if prev_interval ends after current interval starts, merge them and reassign to prev
        - Keep iterating over the intervals list. Prev would be merged with all overlapping intervals
