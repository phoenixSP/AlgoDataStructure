# Backtracking

A **backtracking algorithm** works by recursively exploring all possible solutions to a problem. It starts by choosing an initial solution, and then it explores all possible extensions of that solution. If an extension leads to a solution, the algorithm returns that solution. If an extension does not lead to a solution, the algorithm backtracks to the previous solution and tries a different extension.

The following is a general outline of how a backtracking algorithm works:

1. Choose an **initial** solution.
2. Explore all possible extensions of the **current** solution.
3. If an extension leads to a solution, **return** that solution.
4. If an extension does not lead to a solution, **backtrack** to the **previous** solution and try a different extension.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible solutions have been explored.
