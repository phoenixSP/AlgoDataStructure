# ðŸŸ¡ Word Search I

Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board: List[List[str]], word: str) -> bool:
        '''
        Solution: 
        - We use backtracking as we need to do dfs on the "graph"/grid
        - Normal DFS is used to traverse only one path without backtracking, whereas backtracking DFS does it differently (by backtracking out of failing paths)
        
        TC: O(m*n*dfs) -> O(m*n*4^L)
        TC of Backtracking dfs = 4^len(word) because each position in the word can lead to 4 potential moves, and that can happen max L times 
        '''
        
        def dfs(i,j, index, visited):

            if index == len(word):
                return True

            if i >= len(board) or i < 0 or j >= len(board[0]) or j < 0:
                return False

            if board[i][j] == word[index] and (i,j) not in visited:
                visited.add((i,j))
                found = dfs(i+1, j, index+1, visited) or dfs(i, j+1, index+1, visited) or dfs(i-1, j, index+1, visited) or dfs(i, j-1, index+1, visited)
                visited.remove((i,j))

                return found
            
            return False


        for i in range(len(board)):
            for j in range(len(board[0])):
                if word[0] == board[i][j]:
                    visited = set() # item removal TC: O(1)
                    if dfs(i, j, 0, visited):
                        return True
        return False

1. **Prune 1:**\
   _Return false if the length of the word is greater than the number of cells (R\*C) of the matrix._
2. **Prune 2:**\
   _Return false if the count of any letter in the word exceeds the count of that letter in the matrix. For example: if â€˜aâ€™ appears 3 times in the word but only twice in the matrix, the word cannot exist in the puzzle._
3. **Prune 3:**\
   _Count the number of times the first and the last letter of the word appear in the puzzle. if **count(last\_letter) > count (first\_letter)**, reverse the word and then search for it in the puzzle. It helps in minimizing the number of combinations to be checked._

* _For example: **â€˜abbafcafâ€™**_\
  _Letâ€™s consider that the first letter â€˜aâ€™ appears 4 times in the puzzle while the last letter â€˜fâ€™ appears only twice. If we start with â€˜aâ€™ as our first letter, in the worst case, we will have to run through all the 4 combinations to match the word._
* _Reversed string: **â€˜facfababaâ€™**_\
  _With the word reversed, even in the worst case, we will only have to run through 2 combinations to find if the solution exists or not._
