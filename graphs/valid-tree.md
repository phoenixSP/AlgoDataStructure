# ðŸŸ¡ Valid Tree

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of **undirected** edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

**Note:**

* You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are `undirected`, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in edges.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
