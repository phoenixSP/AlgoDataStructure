# ðŸŸ¡ 01 Matrix

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return _the distance of the nearest_ `0` _for each cell_.

The distance between two adjacent cells is `1`.

```python
from collections import deque
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def updateMatrix(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        '''
        Solution: 
        - Perform BFS on all the positions and check if all of them are visited
        - if the position is a 0, then their distance is 0
        - if an position is a 1 and has 0 in its neighborhood, then the distance is 1
        - if the position is a 1 with no 0 in its neighborhood, then its distance is min(all neighbor's distance) + 1

        TC: DFS O(m*n)
        SC: O(m*n)
        
        Note: Implicit Visit Tracking is done when the distance is updated from inf to standard number, thats why visited set is not needed
