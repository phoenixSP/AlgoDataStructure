# ðŸŸ¡ Course Schedule

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

* For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= 5000`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* All the pairs prerequisites\[i] are **unique**.

            course_map[crs] = [] # since we found that crs can be completed, thus, we can make the prerequisite empty to reduce the need to recompute again
            visited.remove(crs) # we checked if crs can be completed, now for other courses, we need to make it visited=False again

            return True
