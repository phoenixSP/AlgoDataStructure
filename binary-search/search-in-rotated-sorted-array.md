# ðŸŸ¡ Search in Rotated Sorted Array

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct**values).

Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
</strong><strong>Output: -1
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 3:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: nums = [1], target = 0
</strong><strong>Output: -1
</strong></code></pre>

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
* `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
* All values of `nums` are **unique**.
* `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
* `-104 <= target <= 104`

        - Look at the problem from a two array pov: a left array and a right array
        - The left and right array are both increasing in nature, and the max element 
        in right array is lesser than the left array min element
        - If target is in left array, check if it is greater than mid. If target is greater, then 
        target should be to the right of mid. If target is smaller than mid, it can be either in the left of mid, 
        or in the right array. 
        - Cases can be condensed together
