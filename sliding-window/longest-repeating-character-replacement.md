# ðŸŸ¡ Longest Repeating Character Replacement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
</strong></code></pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><code><strong>Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
</strong><strong>Output: 4
</strong><strong>Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
</strong>The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
</code></pre>

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
* `0 <= k <= s.length`

        Notepad:

        s -> string, k -> allowed number of replacements
        So if we want the longest substring with k replacements, we have to keep a note of the majority character in the window. Everything else would have to be covered by the k replacements

        so let's consider a window.. with left and right pointers and a window directory with count vals
        when we look at right, check if char is in dict
        - if char in dict, increment count.
        - if char not in dict, add it to the dict
        count the major element.. to do this, check the majority count before. if the new char count > previous, update majority count 
        while length of window - majority_count > k, increment left and update window counts
        - recalculate majority count
        - calculate length when the window is valid again

        TC: O(n)
        SC: O(n) if window spans the complete sequence


        '''

        if s is None or len(s) == 0:
            return 0 

        if len(s) < k:
            return len(s)

        left, right = 0, 0
        window = {}
        length = 0
        majority_count = 0

        while right < len(s):
            char = s[right]
            if char not in window:
                # check majority 
                window[char] = 0
            window[char] += 1
            majority_count = max(majority_count, window[char])

            while (right - left + 1) - majority_count > k:
                # extra chars
                window[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

                # this is wrong
                # and unnecessary. If we saw a window with x max freq, we would compare all subsequent windows with that freq, until we find a bigger window. So always update the length if case its bigger
                # # recalulcate majority count O(26) = O(1)
                # for ch in window:
                #     majority_count = max(majority_count, window[s[left]])

            length = max(length, right - left + 1)
            right += 1

        return length
