# ğŸ”´ Find Median from Data Stream

Implement the MedianFinder class:

* `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
* `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
* `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

# Leetcode 295: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/description/

from heapq import heappush, heappop
class MedianFinder:
    '''
    Brute force solution is to maintain a sorted array while adding the elements. This makes the sorting O(n) where n is current length and median calculation O(1). We can improve the sorting (sort of) better by using heaps. 

    Solution: 
    - Maintain two heaps, a max heap and a min heap. The maxHeap contains all the numbers to the left/including median and the minHeap contains the numbers to greater/including the median
    - Insert each number into the max heap if it is smaller than the root of the max heap, and into the min heap otherwise
    - Balance the heaps by transfering the roots between the heaps
    - Calculate the median by taking the average of the roots of both heaps if they are of equal size, or by taking the root of the max heap otherwise.

## Follow up 1 and 2

1. If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?
2. If `99%` of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range `[0, 100]`, how would you optimize your solution?

```python
class MedianFinder:
    '''
    Follow up 1: 

    - Use a counter for count of the incoming numbers and keep track of total count
    - Median is position total_count//2 + 1 if total_count is odd, else average of total_count/2 and total_count/2 + 1 positions

    TC: O(1) 
    SC: O(1) # constant length array

    Follow up 2:
    - Since 99% of the numbers fall in the same range, we can use the same algo and keep track of the number of data points that are smaller the 0 or greater than 100. The median will shift #bigger - #smaller to the right
