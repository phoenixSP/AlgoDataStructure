# ðŸŸ¡ K Closest Points to Origin

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

from heapq import heappush, heappop
import numpy as np

class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        '''
        Solution: 

        - Calculate all the distances individually and then push the distances in a minHeap
        - Restrict the minHeap size to k and use heappop followed by push to keep the length constant
        - Multiply the distance with a negative to pop out bigger numbers 

        TC: O(k) [initial heap] + O((n-k)logk) == O(nlogk)
        SC: O(k)
        '''

        if points is None or len(points) == 0:
            return []

        heap = []

        for i, pt in enumerate(points):
            distance = np.sqrt(pt[0]**2 + pt[1]**2)
            heappush(heap, (-distance, i, pt))

            if len(heap) > k:
                # first push the new pt, then pop the extra one
                heappop(heap)

        res = []
        while heap:
            _, _, pt = heappop(heap)
            res.append(pt)

        return res
```
{% endcode %}

The heap can store (distance, i, pt). While we iterate of the list of points, we check if the current distance is smaller than top(heap). If yes, then pop first, and then add the element. This is wrong, because then insted of popping the largest element in the heap, we are popping the second smallest one. So, we HAVE TO use a data structure that enables us to pop the biggest element till now, which would be a max heap.&#x20;
