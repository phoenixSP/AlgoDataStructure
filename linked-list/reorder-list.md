# ðŸŸ¡ Reorder List

You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

```
L0 â†’ L1 â†’ â€¦ â†’ Ln - 1 â†’ Ln
```

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

```
L0 â†’ Ln â†’ L1 â†’ Ln - 1 â†’ L2 â†’ Ln - 2 â†’ â€¦
```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
