# ðŸŸ¢ Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list_.

        - Use a dummy node for the beginning and a pointer tail to point at the last "makeshift" list
        - Point tail to the smaller element of list1 and list2, and move the linked list head to the head 
        - Check at the end if there's any extra elements left in either of the linked lists, and add it to tail
