# Tree

* Hierachical abstract data structure with a set of connected nodes
* Each node can be connected to many children, but a child must have only one parent. The root node is the exception to this rule, which has no parent
* Trees are undirected and connected acycitc graphs with no cycles or loops
* They are commonly used to represent hierarchical data, eg. file systems, JSON, HTML.
